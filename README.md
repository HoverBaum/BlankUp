# BlankUp

Markdown editor.

Build on a lot of cool things soon to be named here and hopefully Electron for native apps.

Huge props to [markdown-editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) where the basics of this came from. After that it really is mainly sugar.

Roadmap:

- [x] Refactore styling to use Stylus
- [x] Move to a Genesis like color scheme because I love it
- [ ] Use a bundler for NPM packages
- [ ] Make some improvements to editor
 	- [x] Lists, highlight markers
 	- [ ] Include something to autoclose things like bold
 	- [ ] Probably need to improve dynamic size of editor
- [ ] Also some for the preview
	- [ ] Todo list to work
	- [x] Styling
- [ ] Preview toggleable
- [ ] Let user change the size of editor compared to preview
- [ ] Make preview scroll alongside editor always and in a nicer way
- [ ] Come up with a way to set styling
- [ ] Pack all the things into a single JS file
