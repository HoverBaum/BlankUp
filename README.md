A clear and simple markdown editor.

Build on and using:
- CodeMirror
- Markdown-it
- Browserify
- Stylus

Huge props to [markdown-editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) where the basics of this came from. After that it really is mainly sugar.

Roadmap:

- [x] Refactore styling to use Stylus
- [x] Move to a Genesis like color scheme because I love it
- [x] Use a bundler for NPM packages
- [x] Make some improvements to editor
 	- [x] Lists, highlight markers
 	- [x] Jump to editor if container is clicked
- [x] Also some for the preview
	- [x] Todo list to work
	- [x] Styling
- [x] Preview toggleable
- [x] Make preview scroll alongside editor always and in a nicer way
- [x] Pack all the things into a single JS file
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Manual Testing
