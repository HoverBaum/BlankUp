# Features

- GitHub flavoured markdown (GFM)
- Toggleable live preview
- With emoji support

## Roadmap

This is a well working beta version. In fact if you only want an editor for markdown that works out of the box BlankUp is already perfect for you. Though there are great things coming. Since we are build on markdown-it we will enable you to use any of it's plugins. We also want to create an easy API (or something) to style the editor.

# API

# Credits

Build on and using:
- [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror)
- [Markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)
- [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
- [Stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus)

Huge props to [markdown-editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) where the basics of this came from. After that it really is mainly sugar.
