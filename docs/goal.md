# Goal

This strives to build a JS based markdown editor that can be initiated on any DOM element. It should than take over this node and display an editor within it.

The editor will have somewhat of a WYSIWYG feel in the sense that syntax will be highlighted and headlines bigger. It will also provide a toggleable live-preview.

## BlankUp(DOMElement, initialValue, options)

```javascript
options: {

}
```
